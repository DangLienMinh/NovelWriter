Wayward's list of things to do:
  Genorators:
    -Hero
      male
      female
      (non binary?)
    -Items 
      important
      trival
      how many (based on World size)
    -Towns
      Status/size
        rich big
        rich medium
        middle-income big
        middle-income medium
        middle-income small
        poor medium
        poor small
      (importance?)
      People
        This will generate a number based on status/size and then run the NPC genorater that number of times.
        Then it will assign stats to these random people, again, based on status/size 
          eg. mayor, pesent, king, nobility, merchant, ect.
      A map
      Enterable house (if possible)
        eg. Tavern, 
      how many (based on World size)
