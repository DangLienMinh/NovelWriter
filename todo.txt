Wayward's list of things to do:
  Genorators:
    -Hero
    Gender
        male
        female
        (non binary?)
      Appenence
      D&D stats
    -Items 
      Weapons
        Type of weapon(Sword, Mace, Pike, etc.)
        D&D stats
      Trinkets
        Items that aren't weapons(Necklaces, braclets, cloaks, etc.)
        D&D stats
      Importance
        There can only be one importante item per game. This item will have a magic D&D modifier and help the Hero.
      how many (based on World size)
    -Towns
      Status/size
        rich big
        rich medium
        middle-income big
        middle-income medium
        middle-income small
        poor medium
        poor small
      (importance?)
      People
        This will generate a number based on status/size and then run the NPC genorater that number of times.
        Then it will assign stats to these random people, again, based on status/size 
          eg. mayor, pesent, king, nobility, merchant, ect.
      A map
      Enterable house (if possible)
        eg. tavern, castle, witches house?
      how many (based on World size)
    -NPCs
      Monsters
        Mindless creatures that will sometimes attack the Hero
        D&D stats
        Depending on the environment the Hero is in, different monsters will spawn
      Peope
        This will generate all of the nondiscript, filler people 
        Apperance
        D&D stats
      Allies
        More important people to the story that help the Hero on their quest
        Apperance
        D&D stats
      Enemies
        Like Allies but evil
        Apperance
        D&D stats
      Villain
        The Big Bad
        Apparance
        D&D stats
        (Maybe also a giant creature?eg. Dragon, town sized bear? Hydra, ect.)
    - World
      Size
        Big
        Medium
        Small
      Biomes
       For each world size, there are a set number of biomes it can have. Choose from a list of biomes and randomly place
       them in the world
      Towns
        Run the Town gen. depending on size
      Monsters
        Populate the world with mosters depending on Biome
      Map
        physical layout of world
  
  Once everything is generated, we will need to keep track of all that stuff.
  Additional things to keep track of:
    -Moods
      of Hero
      of NPCs
      of Story (eg. if there is a fight, the mood is Tense, ect.)
    -Motivation
      for Villain
      for Enemies
      for Allies
      for Hero
    - Character traits for all major characters
      Allies and Enemies will have one trait
      The Villian and the Hero will have two 
      OR
      Everyone will have one (this will be easier)
  
  The writing stuff
    We will need to define or find some code that defines the rules of the english language.
    Then we need to find huge list of a bunch of words we can use. 
    
    We will need to list our words
      A list for:
        every Emotion
        every Mood
        every Character trait
        all the:
          Verbs
          Nouns
          Adjectives
          Adverbs
          Conjunctions
          ect.
        NPCs
        Allies
        Enemies
        Hero
        Villian
        Towns
          Rich
          Middle-income
          Poor
        World
          Every biome in the world
        Probably more
        
  We will need classes for the sentances we need to generate.
  We will need a class to define how all the word bits work (Verbs, Nouns, ect.)
  A class for all different sentances. (Descriptor, Action, ect.)
  A class that takes the mood and other parameters and uses words based on that.  

  We need to make a timer or pseudo-timer
    It takes a step every tiny amount of time (milisecond?)
    Every step, the Hero moves forward one action
    
  When the world is generated, we also generate a path for the hero.
  This will be based on the other things we generate.
